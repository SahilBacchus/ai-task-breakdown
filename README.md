# AI Task Breakdown


AI Task Breakdown is a web-based tool designed to help students and project managers simplify complex projects by automatically decomposing them into structured, manageable tasks. Using Large Language Models (LLMs), the application transforms project descriptions into clear action items to improve productivity and project clarity.

- **Task Generation**: Automatically breaks down uploaded project descriptions into a detailed task list
- **Visual Organization**: Features a Task Viewer supporting both list and Kanban-style board views
- **Interactive Editing**: Includes a conversational chat interface for adding, removing, or modifying tasks using natural language
